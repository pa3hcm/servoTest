servoTest
=========

This code is used in a simple servotesting device I built for a project
involving lots of servo's that had to be aligned during construction.

The device consists of an Arduino, a 5V power supply, a 16x2 LCD display
and a potentiometer. The potmeter allows you to set the angle, which is
shown in the display. The display also shows you the pulse width of the
PWM signal.
